Include text of a standard root-directory file such as `LICENSE.md`.

This inclusion exists so that text isn't duplicated.
We could add YAML headers to root-directory files, but this has proven to be simpler to maintain.
Note that this inclusion strips out the H1-level header of the included root-directory file
so that the page's title on the website will have the same format as other page titles.
